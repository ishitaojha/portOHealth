                <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.
                    <br />
                    AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.
